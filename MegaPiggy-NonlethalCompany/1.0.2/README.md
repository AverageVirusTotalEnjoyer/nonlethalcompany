Various cheats and commands through in-game chat I made for myself.

Based on [Remote Terminal](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/hesukastro/LCRemoteTerminal) mod

Be careful not to make any typos or you might be found out.
Even though you surviving being eaten by a Forest Giant or Eyeless Dog with god mode is already suspicious.

God Mode, No Damage, Speed Jump, and Infinite Stamina are all enabled by default. There is no configs for that. Just change in game.

### Commands: 
- /help: View every command available on a tip popup that can't fit them all lol
- /rt: Remote terminal. Can use commands from the terminal anywhere. Good for opening doors or disabling turrets/mines without terminal. Example: "/rt b3" would open the B3 door for you.
- /moons: List moon weathers
- /moons [moonName]: Reroute to moon
- /scan: Scan the moon for objects just like the terminal does. Value of items is not exact, only approximate.
- /dscan: Detailed scan of the current moon. Shows exact value of every item.
- /kms: Kills you 
- /credits [number]: Add credits
- /god [true/false]: Enable or disable god mode (almost godhood. it is no death except for being abandoned, suffocating in mud, drowning, and falling into pit)
- /nd [true/false]: Enable or disable no damage
- /sj [true/false]: Enable or disable increased speed/jump
- /is [true/false]: Enable or disable infinite stamina
- /switch [name]: Switch camera to radar or person
- /tp [name]: Activate teleporter with optional person to teleport
- /intp: Activate inverse teleporter
- /lights: Toggle lights
- /door: Toggle hydraulic ship door
- /time: Get the current time
- /mets: Move every item outside into ship. These only stay in ship if you pick them up and place them back down.
- /unlock: Open every door
- /save: Save your game. I would only use this in space but I don't know what happens if you try it on a moon.
